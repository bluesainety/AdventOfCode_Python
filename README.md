This is my Advent of Code directory, which was started during the 2023 advent of code. All programs are coded in Python 3.

I am still very much learning the language and the process of AoC so clean and efficient solutions are NOT guaranteed :).
Some solutions may have some notes on how it should be ran or how other remarks about the correctness of the solution, you can find those in comments in the code itself for now.
